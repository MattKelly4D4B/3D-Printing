# 3D-Printing
3D Printing firmware and projects. It's probably my favorite hobby.

I currently have three 3D printers running on Klipper firmware.

The Klipper firmware is special because it uses a raspberry pi to act as a processor for some of the 
computations a 3D printer has to make, thus lightening the load on the printer's actual motherboard.  
In turn you see much better quality and faster print speeds. There is a fork of the klipper repository
in my repositories, and I will also upload a copy of the current version as of 6/28/2022 here.

These are my pritners and the modifications i've done to them.

  Creality Ender 3 Pro (Cartesian printer) -- Biqu H2 500c extruder, dual z axis kit, 4x 2208 stepper motor drivers, MKS Gen L motherboard, upgraded bed springs. 

  Voxelab Aquila (Cartesian printer) -- 3D Printed direct drive mount in pa6-gf nylon, upgraded bed springs and leveling knobs.

  FLSun QQS Pro (Delta Printer) -- BMG extruder, 3D printed mount to mount the extruder lower (Shortens length of bowden tube).
